football
========

This is a simple text-based game that is supposed to be kind of like
playing football at a high level.  You make your moves, you guess your
opponents moves, and if you avoid their moves and guess their moves
correctly, you win.  Otherwise, if they do better, you loose.  Your
only playing move is to put forth numbers and guess numbers, however.

The theme is "Vikings versus the Packers" because this game was
purpose-built for an intranet webpage called "Fun with the Vikings,
starring Viking Bear."  And yes, it was a very tiny website that was
only ever used from Windows computers, until now.
